        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
            <blockquote></blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;Since childhood, I’ve wondered what it would be like to be a college student.<sup>1</sup>  I 
            imagined it as a time of freedom, where you could do anything you wanted, but I soon 
            realized that it’s not always as ideal as it seems.<sup>2</sup> My journey began as a little child, naive 
            and unaware of the complexities of life.<sup>3</sup> I spent my days playing with cousins, uncles, 
            and relatives, all living in the same neighborhood.<sup>4</sup> 
            I was tiny, so small and thin that the 
            wind seemed to blow me away, making me the "saling ketket" in every game.<sup>5</sup> that the 
            wind seemed to blow me away, making me the "saling ketket" in every game. Despite 
            this, they still played with me, often carrying me just to help our group win.<sup>6</sup>I remember 
            one game of chinese garter where the rule was "dead mother, dead all."<sup>7</sup> It meant that 
            the mother can still save her daughter even if she did not make it, my cousins would save 
            me because of my short legs and because I can’t reach it.<sup>8</sup>  After hours of outdoor play, 
            I’d hear my lola calling me from our house on the corner of the street.<sup>9</sup>. Her voice echoed 
            down the block, and I knew it was time to hurry home before she’d get upset.<sup>10</sup> Take note 
            that our house is the first one you will see from our block. Imagine my lola’s booming 
            voice and the number of people who will hear it simply to get me home.<sup>11</sup> Though I felt 
            embarrassed by her loud calls, I understood later that she only worried about me.<sup>12</sup> She 
            always made sure I took my afternoon naps, warning me I wouldn’t grow tall if I didn’t 
            sleep enough.<sup>13</sup>. After a nap, I’d run back outside to play, my world revolving around endless 
            games and adventures.<sup>14</sup> Those were the days when the only thought that mattered was 
            having fun.<sup>15</sup>Looking back, I realize how blessed I was to have such a carefree childhood 
            filled with mischief and laughter.<sup>16</sup>I’ll never forget the memories of sliding on plywood with 
            a plastic chair or losing every round of pogs to my cousins.<sup>17</sup>My childhood was a time of 
            pure joy, and I’ll cherish every moment.<sup>18</sup>Little did I know that I was only at the beginning 
            of a much longer journey, one full of new challenges and experiences.<sup>19</sup>As I grew older, I 
            learned that there was so much more to life than what I had experienced so far.<sup>20</sup>My 
            childhood was the foundation for everything that was to come, and I’ll always treasure 
            those unforgettable years.<blockquote><blockquote>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>
            <blockquote></blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to my teenage years, a time where life got a little messier, yet full of 
            adventures.<sup>1</sup>I began my high school journey at the University of the East-Manila, where 
            I met many incredible people who would become an important part of my life.<sup>2</sup>We bonded 
            over shared dreams of getting rich, traveling the world, shopping sprees, and living for 
            the thrill of new experiences.<sup>3</sup>I was just your typical teenage girl who loved hanging out 
            with friends.<sup>4</sup>After class, we’d often grab a bite to eat, exchange endless stories, and lose 
            track of time, only to realize we’d stayed out way too late.<sup>5</sup>However, life had its own 
            plans, and my family had to move because of unresolved issues with our old house.<sup>6</sup>  It 
            was tough for me, as it meant adjusting to a whole new neighborhood and unfamiliar 
            surroundings.<sup>7</sup>The change was overwhelming, and I had to navigate this new 
            environment, trying to get comfortable with the unknown.<sup>8</sup>n. But after some time, I made 
            friends in the new neighborhood, and they eventually became close to our family..<sup>9</sup>It 
            actually took me three years to really connect with them.<sup>10</sup>The turning point came during
            the COVID lockdowns when I felt suffocated being stuck indoors.<sup>11</sup>Craving fresh air and 
            new faces, I finally stepped outside, and those casual conversations led to lasting 
            friendships that I still hold dear to this day.<sup>12</sup>Even now, as we continue living in the same 
            house, I’m grateful for the bonds I formed during that unexpected time.<sup>13</sup>My teenage 
            years were filled with moments that my mom would probably not approve of, except for 
            drugs.<sup>14</sup>I remember one time, convincing her that we had a group project to work on, 
            when in reality, we were just hanging out and having fun.<sup>15</sup>I had to be creative to make 
            it sound like we were focused on schoolwork.<sup>16</sup>Around the same time, I guilt-tripped her 
            into letting me go to a sleepover at my friend’s house, promising I’d done all the chores 
            at home and deserved a little break.<sup>17</sup>It felt like a small victory, but looking back, it was 
            all part of the carefree chaos of being a teenager. <sup>18</sup>Those years were when I tried 
            everything—going to my first party, using a fake ID to get into a club, having sleepovers, 
            skipping class like I was a bad girl but I’m not, and learning how to play billiards after 
            school.<sup>19</sup>I had so much fun that now, I often find myself wishing I could go back to that 
            time—when the biggest worry was just living in the moment.<sup>20</sup> It was a time of freedom, 
            where I let life guide me wherever it was meant to go.<blockquote><blockquote>

            <blockquote></blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I’m living in the reality of college life. Before, I was just this carefree girl, 
            living in the moment and dreaming of new adventures, all while aspiring to become a 
            nurse. <sup>1</sup>But life doesn’t always go according to plan, and sometimes it turns everything 
            upside down.<sup>2</sup> Before I even became a freshman, our life was flipped around. My mom 
            resigned from her job, and we were still coping with the aftermath of the pandemic.<sup>3</sup>It 
            was a tough time for me because I had no idea what school I would be attending.<sup>4</sup>I 
            wasn’t accepted into the state university I had applied to, and on top of that, my debut 
            was just around the corner.<sup>5</sup>Everything was planned and ready to go, but suddenly, due 
            to financial struggles, I had to prioritize my education.<sup>6</sup> It broke my heart to let go of the 
            dream of having the perfect debut.<sup>7</sup>I was just a girl who wanted to experience that 
            moment, but I understood that sometimes, we have to make sacrifices for the future.<sup>8</sup>Despite everything, I still decided to enroll at the University of the East-Manila. I chose 
        to pursue an I.T  course because it seemed to be in high demand at the time.<sup>9</sup>Unfortunately, I had to let go of my dream of becoming a nurse due to the high tuition 
            fees and the cost of textbooks.<sup>10</sup>The I.T. program, however, offered more flexibility, 
            allowing me to manage my time better.<sup>11</sup>I realized that by simply dedicating myself to 
            learning and embracing the subject, I could still build a rewarding career.<sup>12</sup>As I began my 
            freshman year, I quickly realized that every student had their own unique story about 
            how they ended up in that position.<sup>13</sup> Some were scholars, others had their studies 
            supported by relatives, while some were privileged enough to be financially secure and 
            had little to worry about.<sup>14</sup> There were also working students, balancing jobs alongside 
            their studies, and then there were those who were simply getting through each day, 
            doing whatever they could to make ends meet.<sup>15</sup>Each person’s journey was different, but 
            they all shared a common goal of pushing through and pursuing their dreams. So far, my 
            college journey has been rewarding.<sup>16</sup> I’m surrounded by supportive people who help each 
            other succeed.<sup>17</sup>  Even though the course can be difficult, we lighten the load by 
            encouraging one another, all while striving for high scores and passing grades each 
            semester.<sup>18</sup>  Even though the course can be difficult, we lighten the load by 
            encouraging one another, all while striving for high scores and passing grades each 
            semester. <sup>19</sup> But I’m determined to improve and grow. 
            Once I get that diploma, I’ll face the real-world challenges that come with life, and I 
            understand the importance of pushing through.<sup>20</sup> I believe things will get better and that 
            these experiences will help shape me into a better version of myself. <blockquote><blockquote>
