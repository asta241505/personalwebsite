            Now, I’m living in the reality of college life. Before, I was just this carefree girl, 
    living in the moment and dreaming of new adventures, all while aspiring to become a 
    nurse. <sup>1</sup>But life doesn’t always go according to plan, and sometimes it turns everything 
    upside down.<sup>2</sup> Before I even became a freshman, our life was flipped around. My mom 
    resigned from her job, and we were still coping with the aftermath of the pandemic.<sup>3</sup>It 
    was a tough time for me because I had no idea what school I would be attending.<sup>4</sup>I 
    wasn’t accepted into the state university I had applied to, and on top of that, my debut 
    was just around the corner.<sup>5</sup>Everything was planned and ready to go, but suddenly, due 
    to financial struggles, I had to prioritize my education.<sup>6</sup> It broke my heart to let go of the 
    dream of having the perfect debut.<sup>7</sup>I was just a girl who wanted to experience that 
    moment, but I understood that sometimes, we have to make sacrifices for the future.<sup>8</sup>Despite everything, I still decided to enroll at the University of the East-Manila. I chose 
    to pursue an I.T  course because it seemed to be in high demand at the time.<sup>9</sup>Unfortunately, I had to let go of my dream of becoming a nurse due to the high tuition 
    fees and the cost of textbooks.<sup>10</sup>The I.T. program, however, offered more flexibility, 
    allowing me to manage my time better.<sup>11</sup>I realized that by simply dedicating myself to 
    learning and embracing the subject, I could still build a rewarding career.<sup>12</sup>As I began my 
    freshman year, I quickly realized that every student had their own unique story about 
    how they ended up in that position.<sup>13</sup> Some were scholars, others had their studies 
    supported by relatives, while some were privileged enough to be financially secure and 
    had little to worry about.<sup>14</sup> There were also working students, balancing jobs alongside 
    their studies, and then there were those who were simply getting through each day, 
    doing whatever they could to make ends meet.<sup>15</sup>Each person’s journey was different, but 
    they all shared a common goal of pushing through and pursuing their dreams. So far, my 
    college journey has been rewarding.<sup>16</sup> I’m surrounded by supportive people who help each 
    other succeed.<sup>17</sup>  Even though the course can be difficult, we lighten the load by 
    encouraging one another, all while striving for high scores and passing grades each 
    semester.<sup>18</sup>  Even though the course can be difficult, we lighten the load by 
    encouraging one another, all while striving for high scores and passing grades each 
    semester. <sup>19</sup> But I’m determined to improve and grow. 
    Once I get that diploma, I’ll face the real-world challenges that come with life, and I 
    understand the importance of pushing through.<sup>20</sup> I believe things will get better and that 
    these experiences will help shape me into a better version of myself.
