            Since childhood, I’ve wondered what it would be like to be a college student.<sup>1</sup>  I 
    imagined it as a time of freedom, where you could do anything you wanted, but I soon 
    realized that it’s not always as ideal as it seems.<sup>2</sup> My journey began as a little child, naive 
    and unaware of the complexities of life.<sup>3</sup> I spent my days playing with cousins, uncles, 
    and relatives, all living in the same neighborhood.<sup>4</sup> 
    I was tiny, so small and thin that the 
wind seemed to blow me away, making me the "saling ketket" in every game.<sup>5</sup> that the 
    wind seemed to blow me away, making me the "saling ketket" in every game. Despite 
    this, they still played with me, often carrying me just to help our group win.<sup>6</sup>I remember 
    one game of chinese garter where the rule was "dead mother, dead all."<sup>7</sup> It meant that 
    the mother can still save her daughter even if she did not make it, my cousins would save 
    me because of my short legs and because I can’t reach it.<sup>8</sup>  After hours of outdoor play, 
    I’d hear my lola calling me from our house on the corner of the street.<sup>9</sup>. Her voice echoed 
    down the block, and I knew it was time to hurry home before she’d get upset.<sup>10</sup> Take note 
    that our house is the first one you will see from our block. Imagine my lola’s booming 
    voice and the number of people who will hear it simply to get me home.<sup>11</sup> Though I felt 
    embarrassed by her loud calls, I understood later that she only worried about me.<sup>12</sup> She 
    always made sure I took my afternoon naps, warning me I wouldn’t grow tall if I didn’t 
    sleep enough.<sup>13</sup>. After a nap, I’d run back outside to play, my world revolving around endless 
    games and adventures.<sup>14</sup> Those were the days when the only thought that mattered was 
    having fun.<sup>15</sup>Looking back, I realize how blessed I was to have such a carefree childhood 
    filled with mischief and laughter.<sup>16</sup>I’ll never forget the memories of sliding on plywood with 
    a plastic chair or losing every round of pogs to my cousins.<sup>17</sup>My childhood was a time of 
    pure joy, and I’ll cherish every moment.<sup>18</sup>Little did I know that I was only at the beginning 
    of a much longer journey, one full of new challenges and experiences.<sup>19</sup>As I grew older, I 
    learned that there was so much more to life than what I had experienced so far.<sup>20</sup>My 
    childhood was the foundation for everything that was to come, and I’ll always treasure 
    those unforgettable years.
