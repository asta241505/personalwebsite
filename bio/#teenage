            Fast forward to my teenage years, a time where life got a little messier, yet full of 
    adventures.<sup>1</sup>I began my high school journey at the University of the East-Manila, where 
    I met many incredible people who would become an important part of my life.<sup>2</sup>We bonded 
    over shared dreams of getting rich, traveling the world, shopping sprees, and living for 
    the thrill of new experiences.<sup>3</sup>I was just your typical teenage girl who loved hanging out 
    with friends.<sup>4</sup>After class, we’d often grab a bite to eat, exchange endless stories, and lose 
    track of time, only to realize we’d stayed out way too late.<sup>5</sup>However, life had its own 
    plans, and my family had to move because of unresolved issues with our old house.<sup>6</sup>  It 
    was tough for me, as it meant adjusting to a whole new neighborhood and unfamiliar 
    surroundings.<sup>7</sup>The change was overwhelming, and I had to navigate this new 
    environment, trying to get comfortable with the unknown.<sup>8</sup>n. But after some time, I made 
    friends in the new neighborhood, and they eventually became close to our family..<sup>9</sup>It 
    actually took me three years to really connect with them.<sup>10</sup>The turning point came during
    the COVID lockdowns when I felt suffocated being stuck indoors.<sup>11</sup>Craving fresh air and 
    new faces, I finally stepped outside, and those casual conversations led to lasting 
    friendships that I still hold dear to this day.<sup>12</sup>Even now, as we continue living in the same 
    house, I’m grateful for the bonds I formed during that unexpected time.<sup>13</sup>My teenage 
    years were filled with moments that my mom would probably not approve of, except for 
    drugs.<sup>14</sup>I remember one time, convincing her that we had a group project to work on, 
    when in reality, we were just hanging out and having fun.<sup>15</sup>I had to be creative to make 
    it sound like we were focused on schoolwork.<sup>16</sup>Around the same time, I guilt-tripped her 
    into letting me go to a sleepover at my friend’s house, promising I’d done all the chores 
    at home and deserved a little break.<sup>17</sup>It felt like a small victory, but looking back, it was 
    all part of the carefree chaos of being a teenager. <sup>18</sup>Those years were when I tried 
    everything—going to my first party, using a fake ID to get into a club, having sleepovers, 
    skipping class like I was a bad girl but I’m not, and learning how to play billiards after 
    school.<sup>19</sup>I had so much fun that now, I often find myself wishing I could go back to that 
    time—when the biggest worry was just living in the moment.<sup>20</sup> It was a time of freedom, 
    where I let life guide me wherever it was meant to go.
