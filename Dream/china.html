                    I want to visit China because of its rich history, diverse landscapes, and fascinating mix of ancient and modern culture. 
                    I’m drawn to the country’s impressive landmarks that tell stories of its past and the beautiful natural surroundings that are unlike anywhere else. 
                    The vibrant cities offer a unique atmosphere where tradition and innovation come together, and the country’s diverse regions each have something special to offer. 
                    Whether it's the stunning scenery or the deep cultural heritage, China has so much to explore and experience.

            <p class="how-to-go-description">
            To travel from the Philippines to China, you can book a direct flight from Manila (NAIA) or Cebu (Mactan-Cebu) to major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou. 
            Airlines such as Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and China Eastern offer regular flights. 
            The flight duration is typically around 4 to 5 hours, making China a convenient destination for travelers from the Philippines.</p>

                    <h3>Great Wall of China</h3>
                    <p>The Great Wall of China is a vast, ancient structure that stretches over 13,000 miles. 
                    It was built to protect China from invasions and raids, and it winds through mountains, deserts, and grasslands. 
                    The wall is not just a symbol of strength and resilience but also an incredible feat of engineering, with watchtowers and fortifications along the way. </p>

                    <p>I want to visit the Forbidden City, a grand palace complex in Beijing that was once the imperial residence of Chinese emperors.
                    It covers over 180 acres and consists of nearly 1,000 buildings, all surrounded by a protective wall and moat.
                    The stunning architecture and intricate designs reflect the rich cultural history of China. </p>

                    The Bund is known for its colonial-era buildings that line the Huangpu River, showcasing a mix of European architectural styles.
                    On one side, you have the historic buildings, while on the other, the modern skyscrapers of Lujiazui create a striking contrast. </p>
