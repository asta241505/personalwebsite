                <p class="description"> 
                I want to visit the USA, specifically New York, because of its famous landmarks, rich culture, and bustling atmosphere.
                The city offers iconic sights like the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, and Central Park, which I’m eager to experience firsthand. 
                I’m also excited to explore world-class museums and enjoy New York’s diverse food scene.
                The city’s unique blend of history, modernity, and energy makes it a top destination for me, and I can’t wait to experience everything it has to offer.

                <p class="how-to-go-description">
                    To travel from the Philippines to the USA, you can book a direct flight from Manila (NAIA) to major cities like New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco. 
                    Airlines such as Philippine Airlines, Delta, and United offer direct flights, while other airlines may offer connecting flights with one stop. 
                    The flight duration for direct flights is typically around 13 to 15 hours, depending on the destination city in the USA.
